# Pymap

This is going a little Network Scanner written in python.
Why
* It is mostly an exercise in progamming, different computer communication protocols, projecting, and learning some of what is possible.
* This tool won't be beating out tools like Nmap or the others, but that isn't it's job.

What it does
- This is eventually going to be a full network scanning tool.
  - Will have the ability to ping multiple hosts on the network.
  - Will be able to discover tcp and udp ports and services.
  - Will be able to enumerate service versions and check for remote access.
